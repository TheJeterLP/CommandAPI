CommandAPI
================================
My own made CommandAPI for Bukkit Plugins
Has multiple functions such as:
- multiple commands in one class
- automated help menu
- automated permission checks
- automated arg flags
- simple to use
- no editing of plugin.yml required


For an example project see https://github.com/TheJeterLP/CommandAPIExample

For including into your project use the Maven Shade plugin.
