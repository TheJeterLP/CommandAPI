CommandAPI
================================
My own made CommandAPI for Bukkit Plugins
Has multiple functions such as:
- multiple commands in one class
- automated help menu
- automated permission checks
- automated arg flags
- simple to use
- no editing of plugin.yml required


For an example project see https://github.com/TheJeterLP/CommandAPIExample

For including into your project use the Maven Shade plugin.
Since I dont own a Maven repo, clone this project into your IDE and build it. After that everything shoulld work and it gets 
shaded into your plugin when you build it and have the pom.xml file setup correctly
